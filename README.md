Read Only Memory (ROM) is computer memory that can permanently store data and applications within it. There are various types of ROM with names like EPROM (Eraseable ROM) or EEPROM (Electrically Eraseable ROM).

Unlike RAM, when a computer is powered down, the contents of the ROM are not lost. EPROM or EEPROM can have their contents rewritten by a special operation. This is called 'Flashing the EPROM' a term that came about because ultra violet light is used to clear the contents of the EPROM.

## What is the function of ROM?

Short for Read-Only Memory, ROM is a storage medium that is used with computers and other electronic devices. As the name indicates, data stored in ROM may only be read. It is either modified with extreme difficulty or not at all. ROM is mostly used for firmware updates. A simple example of ROM is the cartridge used with video game.


## Types of ROM:

1. Masked Read Only Memory (MROM):
2. Programmable Read Only Memory (PROM):
3. Erasable and Programmable Read Only Memory (EPROM):
4. Electrically Erasable and Programmable Read Only Memory (EEPROM):
5. FLASH ROM:

## Advantages of ROM

**_The advantages of ROM are as follows_**

1. Non-volatile in nature
2. Cannot be accidentally changed
3. Cheaper than RAMs
4. Easy to test
5. More reliable than RAMs
6. Static and do not require refreshing
7. Contents are always known and can be verified
